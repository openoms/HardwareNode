* Run the forked version of @openoms:  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openoms/raspiblitz/rock64/build_sdcard.sh && sudo bash build_sdcard.sh rock64 openoms`  
This will take a couple minutes depending on your internet connection and the processing power of the SBC.

* Restart when done and log back in now as `admin`:  
`ssh admin@[IP-OF-RASPIBLITZ]`  
password: `raspiblitz`

* From here he setup continues with the [RaspiBlitz Setup Process](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/master/README.md#setup-process-detailed-documentation)
